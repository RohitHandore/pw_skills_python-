        "   - **Independence**: The observations within each group are independent of each other.\n",
        "   - **Normality**: The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed for each group.\n",
        "   - **Homogeneity of variances**: The variance of the residuals is constant across all groups.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Examples of violations:\n",
        "   - Independence: If observations within groups are not independent, such as in repeated measures designs where the same subjects are measured over time, it violates the assumption.\n",
        "   - Normality: If the residuals are not normally distributed within groups, especially for smaller sample sizes, it can affect the validity of ANOVA results.\n",
