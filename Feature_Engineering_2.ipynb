The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that evaluates each feature individually and selects the top-ranked features according to a certain criterion, such as correlation with the target variable or mutual information. It's a fast and efficient method that doesn't consider feature interactions.\n",

        "Q2. The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates a subset of features as a whole, rather than individually. It uses a search algorithm to find the best combination of features that improves the model's performance. Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method considers feature interactions.\n",
