        "1. Homogeneity measures how similar the objects within a cluster are, while completeness measures how well the clusters separate the data. They are calculated using metrics such as precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Yes, a clustering result can have high homogeneity but low completeness if the clusters are very similar but do not separate the data well.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The V-measure can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters by selecting the number of clusters that results in the highest V-measure score.\n",

        "8. Limitations of the Davies-Bouldin Index include its assumption of spherical clusters and its sensitivity to noise and outliers. These limitations can be overcome by using additional metrics and data preprocessing techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Homogeneity, completeness, and the V-measure are related but distinct metrics, and they can have different values for the same clustering result.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. The Silhouette Coefficient can be used to compare the quality of different clustering algorithms on the same dataset, but potential issues include the need to select a common distance metric and the sensitivity to outliers.\n",

        "\n",
        "Note: Clustering evaluation metrics are used to assess the quality of clustering results, and different metrics have different strengths and limitations. It is important to select the appropriate metric for the specific clustering task and dataset."
