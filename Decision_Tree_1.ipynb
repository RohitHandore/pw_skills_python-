        "Q1. The decision tree classifier algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data into smaller subsets based on the values of the input features. Each internal node in the tree represents a feature selection and a split, and each leaf node represents a class label. To make predictions, the algorithm starts at the root node and traverses the tree based on the values of the input features, until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the predicted class label.\n",

The algorithm aims to minimize the entropy in the data by recursively partitioning it into smaller subsets based on the most informative features. The split at each node is chosen to maximize the information gain, which is the reduction in entropy.\n",

The algorithm will recursively partition the data into smaller subsets based on the most informative features, until each subset contains only one class. The predicted class label is then determined by the leaf node that the instance belongs to.\n",
