        "Q1. Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into numerical data that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It's useful in data science because many algorithms require numerical input, and encoding allows us to convert categorical data into a format that can be processed.\n",

        "Q3. Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categories have a natural ordering or hierarchy. For example, in a variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", and \"Master's\", nominal encoding would preserve the ordering, while one-hot encoding would treat each category as a separate feature.\n",
