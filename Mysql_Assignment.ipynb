        "A database is a structured collection of data organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can store various types of data, including text, numbers, images, and more. Databases are commonly used in applications to store and retrieve information efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Structured Data:**\n",
        "   - SQL databases store data in tables with a fixed schema. Each table consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Relational Model:**\n",
        "   - SQL databases use a relational model, where data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are established using keys (e.g., primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ACID Transactions:**\n",
        "   - SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring that database transactions are processed reliably and securely.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Examples:**\n",
        "   - Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Schema-less or Dynamic Schema:**\n",
        "   - NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They allow for flexibility in data representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Document, Key-Value, Graph, or Columnar Models:**\n",
        "   - NoSQL databases can use various models such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, or columnar-based. Each model is optimized for different types of data and access patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Horizontal Scalability:**\n",
        "   - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle large volumes of data across distributed clusters of servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Eventual Consistency:**\n",
        "   - NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, which means they may provide eventual consistency rather than strict consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Examples:**\n",
        "   - Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph-based), Cassandra (columnar), and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Model:** SQL databases use a fixed schema and a relational model, while NoSQL databases can have a flexible schema and various data models.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Scaling:** SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more servers to handle increased load.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transactions:** SQL databases support ACID transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency. NoSQL databases may offer eventual consistency and may not provide full ACID transaction support.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use Cases:** SQL databases are often used for structured data, complex queries, and transactions. NoSQL databases are suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time data, and distributed systems."

        "   - The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
