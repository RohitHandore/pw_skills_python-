        "4. Time series forecasting can be used in business decision-making by predicting future trends and patterns, allowing businesses to make informed decisions about inventory, resource allocation and investments. However, there are common challenges and limitations, such as dealing with non-stationary data, handling missing values and avoiding overfitting.\n",

It takes into account trends, seasonality and residuals to make predictions about future data points. It can be used to forecast time series data by identifying the order of the ARIMA model and using it to make predictions."
