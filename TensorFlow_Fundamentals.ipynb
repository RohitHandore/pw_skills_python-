        "TensorFlow provides several key data structures that are essential for constructing and manipulating tensors. Here are some of the most commonly used data structures in TensorFlow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tensors**: The primary data structure in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors are immutable.\n",

        "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
        "    tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
