        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes necessary functionality. This helps in data hiding and prevents direct access to the data, ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows us to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and interfaces provide a way to define common behavior without specifying the implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class), inheriting its properties and behaviors. It promotes code reusability and allows the subclass to extend or override the functionality of the superclass. Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method name to behave differently based on the object that calls it. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility in the code."
