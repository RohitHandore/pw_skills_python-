        "\n",
        "Q1. Precision and recall are metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. It's calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). The F1 score is different from precision and recall as it combines both metrics to provide a single score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different thresholds. AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures the area under the ROC curve, representing the model's ability to distinguish between classes. Higher AUC values indicate better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Choosing the best metric depends on the problem and dataset. For imbalanced datasets, F1 score or AUC may be more appropriate. For multiclass classification, macro-averaged F1 score or accuracy may be used. Multiclass classification involves more than two classes, whereas binary classification involves only two classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. Logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification using the \"one-vs-rest\" or \"one-vs-all\" approach, where each class is treated as a separate binary classification problem.\n",

        "Q7. Model deployment involves putting a trained model into production to make predictions on new data. It's important as it enables the model to generate value and insights in real-world applications.\n",
