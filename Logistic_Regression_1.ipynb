        "\n",
        "Q1. Linear regression predicts a continuous output variable, while logistic regression predicts a binary output variable (0 or 1, yes or no). Logistic regression is more appropriate when the dependent variable is binary, such as predicting whether a customer will churn (yes or no) based on their attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. The cost function used in logistic regression is the binary cross-entropy loss function, which measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels. Optimization is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation, which finds the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. Regularization in logistic regression adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization are common techniques that reduce the magnitude of model coefficients, leading to simpler models and reduced overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different thresholds. It evaluates the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. A higher ROC curve indicates better performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "These techniques help improve the model's performance by removing irrelevant features, reducing overfitting, and improving generalization.\n",

        "Q6. Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Oversampling the minority class\n",
        "- Undersampling the majority class\n",
        "- Synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE)\n",
        "- Class weighting\n",
        "- Anomaly detection\n",
        "\n",
        "These strategies help address class imbalance by adjusting the dataset or model to give more importance to the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. Common issues and challenges in logistic regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multicollinearity: use regularization, feature selection, or dimensionality reduction\n",
        "- Overfitting: use regularization, cross-validation, or early stopping\n",
        "- Class imbalance: use strategies mentioned earlier\n",
        "- Outliers: use robust regression or data preprocessing techniques\n",
