        "Q1. Ordinal Encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on its order or ranking, while Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering its order or ranking. For example, if you have a variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", and \"Master's\", Ordinal Encoding would assign values 1, 2, and 3 respectively, while Label Encoding would assign arbitrary values like 0, 1, and 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns numerical values to categories based on their relationship with the target variable. It's useful when the categories have a natural ordering that affects the target variable. For example, in a credit risk assessment model, the categories \"Poor\", \"Fair\", \"Good\", and \"Excellent\" could be encoded as 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, based on their increasing creditworthiness.\n",

It's calculated as the sum of the products of the deviations from the mean for each variable, divided by the product of the standard deviations and the number of observations. Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps identify relationships between variables.\n",
