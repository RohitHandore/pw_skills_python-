        "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flask Framework:**\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Flask Framework:**\n",
        "1. **Lightweight and Modular:** Flask is lightweight, making it easy to build and maintain small applications. Its modular nature allows developers to choose and integrate only the libraries and tools they need.\n",
        "2. **Flexibility:** Flask offers great flexibility and allows developers to structure the codebase in a way that suits their needs.\n",
        "3. **Easy to Learn:** Flask has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
        "4. **Extensible:** Flask is highly extensible and can be easily extended with various libraries and tools to add more functionalities as needed.\n",
        "5. **Integrated Development Server:** Flask comes with a built-in development server and a fast debugger, which helps developers test and debug applications quickly.\n",
        "6. **Support for Secure Cookies:** Flask supports secure cookies (client-side sessions), making it easier to handle user sessions securely.\n",
        "7. **Active Community and Documentation:** Flask has a vibrant community and extensive documentation, which is helpful for developers when they encounter issues or need guidance.\n",

        "### Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can create a simple Flask application to display \"Hello World!!\":\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Flask:**\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   pip install Flask\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Create the Flask application (app.py):**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "   @app.route('/')\n",
        "   def hello_world():\n",
        "       return 'Hello World!!'\n",
        "\n",
        "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "       app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Run the application:**\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   python app.py\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To display the output in a Jupyter Notebook, you would typically run the Flask app in the terminal and access it via a web browser, as Flask runs a web server that serves the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
        "\n",
        "**App Routing in Flask:**\n",
        "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions that handle the logic for those URLs. This is done using the `@app.route` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Use App Routes:**\n",
        "- **URL Mapping:** Allows you to define how different URLs in your application are handled.\n",
        "- **Separation of Concerns:** Helps in organizing the code by mapping different URL routes to specific handler functions, making the codebase more maintainable.\n",
        "- **Dynamic URLs:** Supports dynamic URLs with variable parts, enabling more interactive and responsive web applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. Create a “/welcome” route and a root route to show company details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the Flask application for the specified routes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, the `/links` route generates URLs for the `home`, `about`, and `contact` routes using the `url_for()` function and returns HTML links for these URLs. Running this Flask application and navigating to the `/links` route will display clickable links to the other routes."
