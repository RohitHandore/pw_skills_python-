        "Q1. Grid Search CV is a hyperparameter tuning technique that systematically searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameters to find the optimal combination that maximizes model performance. It works by splitting the data into training and validation sets, training the model on the training set with each hyperparameter combination, and evaluating its performance on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Grid Search CV exhaustively searches through all possible hyperparameter combinations, while Randomized Search CV randomly samples a subset of combinations. Grid Search CV is more comprehensive but computationally expensive, while Randomized Search CV is faster but may miss optimal combinations. Choose Grid Search CV for small to medium-sized hyperparameter spaces and Randomized Search CV for large spaces.\n",

        "Q3. Data leakage occurs when a model is trained on data that includes information about the target variable, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. Example: Using a model to predict student grades based on test scores, where the test scores are included in the training data.\n",
