        "### Why and When to Use `while` Loop in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The `while` loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The loop will continue to execute the block of code as long as the condition is `True`. Once the condition becomes `False`, the loop stops executing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Reasons to Use `while` Loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Indeterminate Iteration**:\n",
        "   - Use a `while` loop when you need to repeat a block of code but you don't know in advance how many times you need to iterate. This is known as indeterminate iteration, where the loop continues until a certain condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Condition-Driven Loop**:\n",
        "   - If you need to keep checking a condition after each iteration and the loop should continue as long as the condition holds true, a `while` loop is appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Event-Driven Loop**:\n",
        "   - Use a `while` loop when the loop's continuation is dependent on external events or user input, such as reading data until the end of a file is reached or until a user decides to stop providing input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of `while` Loop\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Indeterminate Iteration**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Condition-Driven Loop**:\n",
        "   - The condition here is `while True`, which means the loop will run indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. The `break` statement is used to exit the loop when the user chooses to exit.\n",
        "\n",
