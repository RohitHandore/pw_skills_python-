        "In the realm of computer vision tasks, **object detection** and **object classification** are two fundamental yet distinct processes. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each, along with examples to illustrate the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Object Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object Classification** involves identifying the class or category of an object in an image. The task is to determine what is present in the image and assign a label to it. The output is a single label (or a set of labels in the case of multi-label classification) for the entire image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: Consider an image containing a dog. An object classification model processes this image and outputs a label \"dog\".\n",

        "- Input: An image of a cat.\n",
        "- Output: The label \"cat\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, object classification can be applied to various tasks such as:\n",
        "- **Image recognition**: Determining if an image contains a cat, dog, car, etc.\n",
        "- **Content filtering**: Classifying images to filter out inappropriate content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Object Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object Detection** goes a step further than classification. It not only identifies the classes of objects present in the image but also determines their locations within the image by outputting bounding boxes around each object. The output consists of one or more labels along with their corresponding coordinates within the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: Consider an image containing multiple objects such as a dog, a cat, and a car. An object detection model processes this image and outputs labels (\"dog\", \"cat\", \"car\") along with bounding boxes specifying the locations of each object.\n",

        "- Output: Labels \"pedestrian\", \"bicycle\", and \"car\" with bounding boxes around each object.\n",

        "- **Output**:\n",
        "  - **Object Classification**: Single or multiple labels for the entire image.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, object classification and object detection serve different purposes in computer vision. Object classification tells us what is in an image, while object detection tells us what is in the image and where those objects are located. Both techniques are essential for building intelligent systems capable of understanding and interacting with the visual world."

        "2. Activation Functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or Sigmoid functions are used to introduce non-linearity, enhancing the ability to learn complex features.\n",
        "3. Pooling Layers: Downsampling the feature maps using max or average pooling reduces spatial dimensions, retaining essential information while reducing computational cost.\n",

        "3. Feature Extraction: The flatten layer and fully connected layers process the feature maps, extracting high-level features and making predictions.\n",
        "4. Backpropagation: Errors are calculated and propagated backward, adjusting weights and biases to optimize the network during training.\n",
