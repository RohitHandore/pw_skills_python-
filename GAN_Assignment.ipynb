        "1. **Data Preparation**: Download and preprocess the CelebA dataset.\n",
        "2. **Generator Network**: Define the generator network, which takes random noise as input and generates fake images.\n",
        "3. **Discriminator Network**: Define the discriminator network, which discriminates between real and fake images.\n",
        "4. **GAN Model**: Combine the generator and discriminator into a GAN model.\n",
