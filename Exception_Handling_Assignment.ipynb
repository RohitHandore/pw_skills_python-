        "In Python, the `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in and custom exceptions. When creating a custom exception, it's essential to inherit from the `Exception` class because it provides essential functionalities and behaviors that are necessary for proper exception handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few reasons why we inherit from the `Exception` class when creating custom exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Consistency and Compatibility:** By inheriting from `Exception`, our custom exception behaves like other built-in exceptions in Python. This ensures consistency in exception handling across different parts of the code and makes our custom exception compatible with existing exception-handling mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Standardized Methods:** The `Exception` class provides standard methods like `__init__` and `__str__` which are used to initialize and represent the exception message. By inheriting from `Exception`, our custom exception can utilize these methods without the need to redefine them, ensuring a consistent interface for exception handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exception Hierarchy:** Inheriting from `Exception` allows our custom exception to participate in the Python exception hierarchy. This hierarchy enables us to catch exceptions at various levels, from specific exceptions to more general ones, facilitating more granular error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Exception Handling:** Python provides built-in mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions of type `Exception`. By inheriting from `Exception`, our custom exception can be caught using standard `except` blocks, making it easy to handle in try-except constructs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Future Compatibility:** Python's exception handling mechanisms may evolve over time. By inheriting from `Exception`, our custom exception is more likely to remain compatible with future changes and updates to the language's exception handling system.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, by inheriting from the `Exception` class, we ensure that our custom exception follows the conventions and standards of Python's exception handling system, making it easier to use and maintain in our codebase."

        "Exception handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable Python code. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Specificity:** Catch exceptions as specific as possible. This helps in understanding the cause of the error and facilitates targeted error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use Try-Except Blocks:** Wrap the code that may raise an exception inside a `try` block and catch the exceptions using `except` blocks. This prevents the program from crashing abruptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handle Exceptions Appropriately:** Handle exceptions gracefully. Depending on the situation, you may want to log the error, notify the user, or provide a fallback option.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Avoid Bare Except:** Avoid using bare `except` clauses (`except:`) as they catch all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `KeyboardInterrupt`. Use specific exception classes instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use Finally:** Use `finally` block to clean up resources, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This is useful for closing files, releasing locks, or cleaning up database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Don't Suppress Errors:** Avoid suppressing errors silently. If you catch an exception, make sure to handle it appropriately or log it for further investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Logging:** Use logging to record exceptions and their context. This helps in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Reraise Exceptions:** If you catch an exception and cannot handle it properly, consider re-raising it using `raise` to propagate the exception to higher levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Custom Exceptions:** Define custom exceptions for specific error conditions in your application. This makes error handling more descriptive and allows for better control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Keep Try Blocks Short:** Keep the `try` blocks as short as possible to narrow down the scope of catching exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Use Context Managers:** Use context managers (`with` statement) to manage resources such as files, database connections, or locks. They ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even in the presence of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Avoid Returning `None` on Exception:** Avoid returning `None` or other sentinel values when an exception occurs. It makes it difficult to distinguish between normal and exceptional cases. Instead, raise an exception or handle it appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Test Exception Handling:** Write tests to verify that exception handling works as expected in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
