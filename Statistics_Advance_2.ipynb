        "Q1: **Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)**:\n",
        "- **PMF**: For discrete random variables, the PMF gives the probability that the variable takes on a specific value. It maps each possible value of the random variable to its probability.\n",
        "- **PDF**: For continuous random variables, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of the variable taking on a particular value within a range. Unlike the PMF, it doesn't give the probability of a specific value but provides the density of probability at each point.\n",
        "- **Example**: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF would give the probability of each outcome (1/6 for each number). If we have a continuous variable like the height of students in a class, the PDF would describe the likelihood of observing a height within a given range.\n",

        "Q2: **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)**:\n",
        "- The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. It represents the cumulative probability up to a certain point.\n",
        "- Example: For a fair six-sided die, the CDF would give the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to a given number. For instance, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 would be 3/6 = 0.5.\n",

        "- Facilitates hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and prediction in various fields such as finance, engineering, and social sciences.\n",
